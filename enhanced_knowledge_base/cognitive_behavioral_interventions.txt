# Cognitive Behavioral Interventions for Workplace Stress

## Cognitive Restructuring Techniques

### Thought Records and Cognitive Distortions
- Catastrophic thinking: "If I make one mistake, I'll lose my job"
- All-or-nothing thinking: "I'm either perfect or a complete failure"
- Mind reading: "My boss thinks I'm incompetent"
- Fortune telling: "This presentation will be a disaster"

### CBT Techniques for Stress Management:
1. **The ABC Model**: Antecedent → Belief → Consequence
2. **Thought challenging**: What's the evidence for/against this thought?
3. **Behavioral experiments**: Testing out feared scenarios
4. **Activity scheduling**: Balancing work and pleasant activities
5. **Problem-solving training**: Define → Generate → Evaluate → Implement

### Workplace-Specific CBT Applications:
- Deadline anxiety: Breaking tasks into smaller, manageable chunks
- Perfectionism: Setting "good enough" standards for different tasks
- Impostor syndrome: Collecting evidence of competence and achievements
- Conflict avoidance: Assertiveness training and communication skills

## Research Evidence:
Meta-analyses show CBT for workplace stress has medium to large effect sizes (d = 0.68)
Particularly effective for anxiety-related workplace issues and burnout prevention.
